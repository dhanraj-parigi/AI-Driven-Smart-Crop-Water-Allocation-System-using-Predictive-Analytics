💧 AI-Driven Smart Crop Water Allocation System using Predictive Analytics

🌾 Agriculture consumes a significant portion of freshwater resources. Efficient water allocation is essential to ensure sustainable farming and meet the needs of agriculture, domestic, and industrial sectors.

This project uses Machine Learning & Predictive Analytics to recommend smart water allocation for crops based on rainfall, soil moisture, and crop type.

🚀 Features

📊 Data Preprocessing & EDA – Cleaned and analyzed crop yield & rainfall datasets.

🤖 Machine Learning Models – Trained Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting & HistGradientBoosting.

🏆 Best Model Selection – Saved the top-performing model as best_water_allocation_model.pkl.

🌐 Streamlit Web App – Interactive interface for farmers & decision-makers.

🔮 Predictions – Input crop type, year, rainfall, and soil moisture → get water allocation % and recommendations.

📈 Visualizations – Trend graphs & bar charts to make results easy to understand.
